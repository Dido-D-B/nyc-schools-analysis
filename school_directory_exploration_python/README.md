# School Directory Exploration — NYC Schools Project

This folder contains the Python-based **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** of the NYC **High School Directory dataset**.  
The goal was to explore school characteristics across boroughs and visualize key metrics such as grade distribution and student counts.

## Objectives

- Explore the NYC school directory data using **Python and Pandas**.  
- Analyze school distribution, grade levels, and average school sizes.  
- Visualize borough-level trends and patterns using **Matplotlib**.  
- Practice structured notebook documentation and clean visual output.

## Files Overview

`notebook.ipynb`: Main Python notebook for data exploration and visualization. 
`visuals/`: Folder containing generated PNG visualizations for borough-level insights. 

## Exploratory Steps

### Data Loading & Cleaning

- Loaded the NYC High School Directory CSV.  
- Standardized column names and checked for missing values.  
- Ensured borough names and grade levels were consistent.

### Descriptive Analysis

- Counted the number of schools per borough.  
- Calculated the average and median number of students per school.  
- Explored grade span (starting and ending grades).  

### Visual Analysis

Created multiple visual summaries:

- **Number of Schools by Borough** — visualized borough-level school counts.  
- **Average Students per Borough** — compared student population averages.  
- **Distribution of School Sizes** — highlighted variation in enrollment sizes.  
- **Starting Grade Distribution** — showed grade span trends by borough.  

All visuals were exported to the `visuals/` folder for documentation and presentation use.

## Tools Used

- **Python (Pandas)**: Data analysis and aggregation
- **Matplotlib**: Visualizations
- **VS Code**: Notebook execution and version control
- **GitHub**: Project collaboration and documentation

## 💡 Key Insights

- Brooklyn and the Bronx host the largest number of schools.  
- Manhattan schools tend to have smaller average student counts.  
- Most boroughs start high school at **Grade 9**, with few exceptions.  
- School size distribution varies widely, suggesting diverse institutional capacities across boroughs.

## Key Learnings

- Practiced translating **spreadsheet-style exploration** into **Python-based EDA**.  
- Improved ability to structure notebooks with clear markdown summaries and visualization outputs.  
- Built familiarity with **data storytelling through visuals**.
